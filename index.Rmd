## About

I am a second-year Master's in Public Health candidate at Columbia University Mailman School of Public Health living in NYC. I believe that epidemiology is not just a powerful methodology to analyze disease, but also a way to consolidate and communicate that data to the public and policy-makers. I hope that my research in epidemiology will be my way of fighting for social justice. My past experiences as a health educator, case manager, clinical provider, contact tracer, and researcher have solidified my passion for infectious disease and health disparities epidemiology.

### Kathak-Indian Classical Dance

I have been learning  and practicing kathak for the last 15 years. It's been hard to practice since starting graduate school and the current pandemic.
