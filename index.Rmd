## About

I am a recent Master's in Public Health graduate from Columbia University Mailman School of Public Health living in NYC. I believe that epidemiology is not just a powerful methodology to analyze disease, but also a way to consolidate and communicate that data to the public and policy-makers. I hope that my research in epidemiology will be my way of fighting for social justice. My past experiences as a health educator, case manager, clinical provider, contact tracer, and researcher have solidified my passion for infectious disease and health disparities epidemiology.
